# MIT OCW Notes

This repository contains my LaTeX notes and problem set solutions to various MIT
OpenCourseWare (OCW) courses.

These notes are by no means a replacement for going through the actual material. They just contain points that I found interesting or important.

If you find anything that needs to be fixed or can be improved, please let me know!

Current courses:
