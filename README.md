# MIT OCW Notes

This repository contains my LaTeX notes and problem set solutions to various MIT
OpenCourseWare (OCW) courses.

These notes are by no means a replacement for going through the actual material. They just contain points that I found interesting or important.

If you find anything that needs to be fixed or can be improved, please let me know!

Current courses:
1. **8.04 Spring 2013 - Quantum Physics I with Allan Adams**

- [YouTube Lecture Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ3bPUKo5zc&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61-9PEhRognw5vryrSEVLPr)

2. **The Missing Semester of Your CS Education**

This technically isn't an OCW course, but I would highly recommend it. The instructors are very knowledgable and I definitely learned a lot. It's a short course but it really helps improve your productivity in writing software.
